web

## Users

Pagecraft serves people who need an instant publishable website and WordPress site owners who want the same visual builder without remaining dependent on a hosted runtime. WordPress v1 is initially for Braudy's own controlled test installation before broader customer distribution.

## Product Purpose

Pagecraft is a visual website builder for creating, previewing, and publishing hosted sites, then optionally handing a complete project to WordPress as independently editable local content. Success means a customer can build either in Cloud or directly in WordPress without requiring synchronization or Pagecraft availability for WordPress rendering.

## Positioning

Pagecraft separates a portable, versioned document from the environment that owns it. Pagecraft Cloud owns the cloud copy; after import, WordPress owns the WordPress copy. The two environments share one document model, compiler, renderer, and editor, but never silently synchronize.

## Operating Context

- Authors work in Pagecraft Cloud or through the same full-page editor embedded in WordPress Admin.
- Cloud connection is optional and revocable through PKCE. The WordPress transfer flow separates choosing a Cloud project from choosing **Replace this site** or **Replace a page**, followed by an explicit impact review. There is no user-facing package upload in this flow.
- Imported pages are native WordPress `page` records. The Pagecraft document is stored in post metadata and compiled fallback HTML is stored in `post_content`.
- WordPress Pages is the canonical page library. Pagecraft adds badges, filters, and “Edit with Pagecraft” actions instead of a duplicate Pages screen.
- Pagecraft navigation is converted to a native WordPress menu and bound back to the imported navigation component; WordPress owns menu content while Pagecraft owns presentation.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Pagecraft supports its current element, component, responsive-style, interaction, asset, SEO, and approved custom-code model in both hosts.
- WordPress v1 supports single-site, WordPress 6.6 or newer, PHP 8.1 or newer, HTTPS, pretty permalinks, and the Pagecraft Theme only.
- Pagecraft-managed pages use the Pagecraft editor for layout. Native WordPress fields, revisions, menus, media, status, author, slug, and integrations remain available.
- Generated CSS and runtime assets live under versioned Pagecraft upload paths rather than being written into the installed theme directory.
- Cloud CMS bindings must be flattened with an explicit warning or rejected during import. Native WordPress data providers are deferred.
- Background synchronization, Cloud push, conflict merging, staging promotion, Gutenberg conversion, existing-theme compatibility, multisite, billing, MCP, ecommerce, and vacation-rental widgets are outside v1.

## Brand Commitments

The product is Pagecraft. Its established interface is a calm editorial workbench: White and cool neutrals are the working surfaces, Ink provides structure, and Craft Green is reserved for action, focus, selection, and status. Hover uses a very light green; warm beige surfaces were removed at the user's request. Manrope and DM Sans, the existing Pagecraft logo assets, and the current compact control vocabulary are incumbent visual authority.

## Evidence on Hand

- The canonical builder, renderer, persisted document model, revision history, and production Pagecraft deployment are in this repository.
- Brand assets and tokens live under `brand/`.
- The current comprehensive demo and test fixtures exercise Pagecraft's supported element and CMS system.
- No public customer claims, pricing, marketplace approval, or production WordPress compatibility evidence exists yet and must not be fabricated.

## Product Principles

- An import is a copy and an ownership handoff, never an implied synchronization relationship.
- Replacement is manual, never synchronization. Site replacement publishes the incoming page collection, replaces Pagecraft navigation/header/footer/homepage, and archives displaced WordPress pages without permanently deleting them. Posts, products, users, plugins and unrelated media remain. A single-page replacement retains its destination URL, title and status and uses page-scoped Cloud header/footer elements. Recovery data is retained privately; an administrator-assisted restore is required until a recovery UI is implemented.
- The legacy programmatic whole-project importer retains merge semantics; it is not labelled as site replacement. The new replacement service adds stale-review rejection, editor locks, transactional database writes and explicit scope boundaries. Hosted acceptance is required before release.
- Stable Pagecraft identities, versioned schemas, deterministic compilation, and file hashes make packages auditable and repeatable.
- Existing WordPress content, navigation, and media are never silently overwritten.
- Published pages retain compiled HTML and CSS so disabling the builder does not blank the site.
- Administrative interfaces state whether content is cloud-owned, imported, or locally WordPress-owned.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

The builder, WordPress administration surfaces, published output, and all existing interactive components must preserve keyboard operation, visible focus, semantic names, responsive reflow, and accessible error/status feedback.
