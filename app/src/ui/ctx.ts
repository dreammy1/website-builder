/* The seam between the ported UI and the legacy one.

   Ported panels do not share a scope with builder.html, and that is not a style
   preference — Preact's bundle declares `$` at top level and so does builder.html, so
   merging them is `Identifier '$' has already been declared` and a dead app. The UI
   bundle is therefore an IIFE, and everything it needs from the old world arrives
   through this file instead of by being in scope.

   That constraint turns out to be the feature. `Legacy` below is an explicit list of
   what is not ported yet: when a panel moves across, the names it used come off the
   list, and the list reaching empty is the migration being finished. An ambient
   `declare function` file would have compiled just as well and told nobody anything.

   `Core` is derived from the module rather than hand-written, so it cannot drift. */
import type * as CoreNs from '../core/index';

/**
 * The whole core module.
 *
 * This started as a `Pick` of the handful of names the first ported panel used, which
 * was honest while the list was short. By the inspector it was heading past sixty, and
 * a hand-written list of core exports is the EXPORTS mistake again — a second list to
 * drift from the first.
 *
 * So `build.mjs` reshapes the core bundle's own trailing `export { … }` into
 * `var __CORE = { … }` and builder.html hands that over. The list is generated from
 * the real exports, this type is the real module, and neither can fall out of step.
