/* The domain, typed.

   This file is the point of the migration. Three bugs shipped in a single session
   because none of this was expressed anywhere:

   - the `rich` control had no `k`, so `bindableKeys` skipped it and a WYSIWYG body
     could not be bound at all — the most useful binding in the CMS, unreachable.
     `Control` makes `k` required on every kind that writes a prop.
   - `slotHits` returned an offset into one string and `snippet` searched a different
     one. `SlotHit` names which string an offset belongs to.
   - `holds(pt, t)` threw on the null container, because "the root" was expressed as
     `null` in some places and as level 0 in others. `Level` and `ParentType` say it.

   Nothing here changes behaviour. It describes what the code already does. */

 * name, which is the failure that actually happens and which used to reach exported HTML
