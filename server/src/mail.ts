/* Getting the link to the person.

   Until now a login link was logged to the console, which is fine for the person running the
   server and useless for everybody else. This sends it.

   ## Why SMTP

   Every provider speaks it — Resend, Postmark, SES, Fastmail, a WordPress host's mail server,
   the box in the corner. An HTTP API would mean picking one of them and writing that choice
   into the code, and there is no reason to. Credentials in the environment, and whoever runs
   this decides whose server carries the mail.

   ## Why nodemailer rather than writing it

   An SMTP client is a hundred lines and about six ways to be subtly wrong: STARTTLS
   negotiation, which AUTH mechanism the server actually offers, header encoding for a name
   with an accent in it, line-ending rules, timeouts that hang a request forever. This is one
   email; it is not worth becoming a mail client to send it.

   ## What the message says

   Short, and specific about what it is for. A login link that reads like marketing is a login
   link people learn to ignore, and one that asks for anything is teaching a habit worth not
   teaching. It says who it is from, what the link does, how long it lasts, and what to do if
   it was not asked for — nothing else, and no tracking of any kind. */
