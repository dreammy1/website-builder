# Production handover — build.itspagecraft.com

Pagecraft runs on the existing Namecheap/cPanel account. Supabase holds the durable data, and
Cloudflare proxies the public hostname.

## Production topology

Hosted-site deletion writes a persistent routing tombstone under the publication root before
removing the database record. Keep these tombstones with the publication data: they prevent
stale pointers or delayed publishing jobs from making deleted sites public again. Immutable
release files remain private; this operation revokes public routing, not archival storage.
Address changes update the routing aliases without modifying immutable release manifests.

- Public URL: `https://build.itspagecraft.com`
- Node 24 application: `/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-app`
- Runtime: CloudLinux Node selector and LiteSpeed Passenger
- Startup bridge: `app.cjs`, which imports `server/src/index.ts`
- Supabase project: `Pagecraft` (`pwgwvicrdbjiecjxiyvl`, Singapore)
- Database bridge: `https://pwgwvicrdbjiecjxiyvl.supabase.co/functions/v1/pagecraft-db-v3`
- Cloudflare: proxied A record to `67.223.118.197`, Full (strict), Always Use HTTPS enabled

Namecheap blocks outbound PostgreSQL ports. The Node process therefore calls the authenticated
Supabase Edge Function over HTTPS. The function exposes a fixed operation list and parameterized
queries; it never accepts caller-provided SQL.

## Production authority

The authoritative Cloud product is the live application at
`https://build.itspagecraft.com`. There is no separately published Cloud or Claude artifact.
The repository sources below produce that deployment:

- Node transport: `server/src/store-gateway.ts`
- Edge Function: `supabase/functions/pagecraft-db/`
- Reproducible schema: `supabase/migrations/`
- Passenger bridge: `app.cjs`

The gateway key is not committed. Supabase stores only its SHA-256 digest in
`public.gateway_config`; the raw value exists only as `DATABASE_GATEWAY_KEY` in the cPanel
application environment.

## Application environment

Required:

| Variable | Value or purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_GATEWAY_URL` | Deployed `pagecraft-db-v3` Edge Function URL |
| `DATABASE_GATEWAY_KEY` | Private raw gateway key; never commit it |
| `EDITOR_HOST` | `build.itspagecraft.com` |
| `EDITOR_ORIGIN` | `https://build.itspagecraft.com` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Public project key used by the server-side SSR client |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | Cloudflare Turnstile widget key for the production hostname |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production`, which enables Secure auth cookies and forbids test challenge mode |
| `PAGECRAFT_PUBLICATION_ROOT` | Persistent, writable absolute directory outside the application deployment, recommended `/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-publications` |

Account email is sent by Supabase Auth through the project's custom SMTP provider. Configure and
test that provider in Supabase before releasing the application; the built-in development mail
service is not a production transport. `OWNER_EMAIL`, `CLIENT_EMAIL`, and the application's old
SMTP variables are legacy rollback settings and are not used by Supabase account mode.
The Turnstile secret belongs only in Supabase Auth's Bot and Abuse Protection settings, not in the
Pagecraft application environment.

Create the publication directory once and keep it outside the rsync `--delete` target:

```bash
ssh -F .pagecraft-local/ssh-config itspagecraft-host \
  'mkdir -p /home/itspbuku/pagecraft-publications && chmod 700 /home/itspbuku/pagecraft-publications'
```

The complete Auth URL, email-template, Turnstile, and local-test checklist is in
[`AUTH_SETUP.md`](AUTH_SETUP.md).

Connected WordPress additionally fails closed until the release trust chain is provisioned:

| Variable | Value or purpose |
|---|---|
| `PAGECRAFT_RELEASE_KEY_ID` | Identifier for the online Ed25519 release key |
| `PAGECRAFT_RELEASE_PRIVATE_KEY` | PKCS#8 release private key encoded as base64url; runtime secret |
| `PAGECRAFT_ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY` | Raw 32-byte offline root public key encoded as base64url |
| `PAGECRAFT_KEYSET_ENVELOPE_BASE64URL` | Root-signed canonical release-key envelope encoded as base64url |
| `PAGECRAFT_IMPORTER_PACKAGE_PATH` | Absolute path to the provisioned Importer ZIP |
| `PAGECRAFT_IMPORTER_PACKAGE_VERSION` | Exact Importer version |
| `PAGECRAFT_BUILDER_PACKAGE_PATH` | Absolute path to the provisioned Builder ZIP |
| `PAGECRAFT_BUILDER_PACKAGE_VERSION` | Exact Builder version |
| `PAGECRAFT_THEME_PACKAGE_PATH` | Absolute path to the theme ZIP |
| `PAGECRAFT_THEME_PACKAGE_VERSION` | Exact theme package version |

Generate the root and release keys on an offline machine with
`node server/tools/provision-release-keys.mjs --profile production --output <protected-path>`.
Use `--profile test` only for the development distribution. The command creates a new mode-0600
file and refuses to overwrite it. Store the root private key offline and the
release private key in the server secret store. Never save either private key in this checkout,
WordPress, a deployment log, or chat. Inject only the root public key while building the private
WordPress packages from the private `pagecraft-wordpress` repository:

```bash
PAGECRAFT_ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64URL='<offline-root-public-key>' \
  bash tools/build-release-candidate.sh 0.2.0
```

The package builder rejects a missing/invalid root key and verifies that the development marker
is absent from the resulting Importer archive. Copy all three archives to a private, non-public
server directory and configure their package path/version variables. The stable endpoint signs
the distribution manifest at runtime; the Importer downloads Builder and Theme only from the
content-addressed URLs bound into that signed manifest.

## Deploy an application update

```bash
cd ~/Projects/pagecraft
npm test

rsync -az --delete -e 'ssh -F .pagecraft-local/ssh-config' server/src/ \
  itspagecraft-host:/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-app/server/src/
rsync -az --delete -e 'ssh -F .pagecraft-local/ssh-config' app/src/core/ \
  itspagecraft-host:/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-app/app/src/core/
rsync -az --delete -e 'ssh -F .pagecraft-local/ssh-config' app/src/host/ \
  itspagecraft-host:/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-app/app/src/host/
rsync -az --delete -e 'ssh -F .pagecraft-local/ssh-config' app/src/package/ \
  itspagecraft-host:/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-app/app/src/package/

  itspagecraft-host:/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-app/brand/logo/
rsync -az -e 'ssh -F .pagecraft-local/ssh-config' brand/pagecraft-favicon.svg \
  itspagecraft-host:/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-app/brand/
rsync -az -e 'ssh -F .pagecraft-local/ssh-config' app.cjs index.html package.json package-lock.json \
  itspagecraft-host:/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-app/

ssh -F .pagecraft-local/ssh-config itspagecraft-host \
  'cloudlinux-selector restart --json --interpreter nodejs \
   --domain build.itspagecraft.com --app-root pagecraft-app'

node tools/smoke.mjs https://build.itspagecraft.com
```

The server imports `app/src/core/`, `app/src/host/`, and `app/src/package/` at runtime for schema
migration, rendering, and portable-package handling. Never deploy `server/src/` without these
matching directories: a newer editor with an older server renderer can accept a document that
production cannot render, while missing host/package modules prevent Passenger from starting.

If dependencies change, run this before restarting. The root production dependencies mirror
the server workspace because CloudLinux installs from the application-root manifest. Do not run
the virtual environment's `npm` directly inside the app root: the selector owns the
`node_modules` symlink.

```bash
ssh -F .pagecraft-local/ssh-config itspagecraft-host \
  'cloudlinux-selector install-modules --json --interpreter nodejs \
   --app-root pagecraft-app --skip-web-check'
```

## Deploy a database change

First reconcile `supabase migration list` with the repository. The live project's historical
version labels predate these checked-in filenames, so do not blindly replay the initial schema
against production. Resolve that history once, then keep the checked-in list authoritative.

Apply new ordered files from `supabase/migrations/` to project
`pwgwvicrdbjiecjxiyvl`, including these Connected WordPress migrations in order:

1. `20260826000000_wordpress_connected_v1.sql`
2. `20260826001638_gateway_release_blob_transport.sql`
3. `20260826004000_wordpress_connection_revocation.sql`
4. `20260827063203_supabase_auth_profiles.sql`

Before touching the live project, prove the complete migration chain, RLS/grant posture, and
database advisors against a disposable PostgreSQL 17 instance:

```bash
server/tools/test-supabase-migrations.sh
server/tools/test-postgres-concurrency.sh

deno fmt --check --config supabase/functions/pagecraft-db/deno.json \
  supabase/functions/pagecraft-db
deno check --config supabase/functions/pagecraft-db/deno.json \
  supabase/functions/pagecraft-db/index.ts
deno test --config supabase/functions/pagecraft-db/deno.json \
  supabase/functions/pagecraft-db
```

Then deploy `supabase/functions/pagecraft-db/` under the production function slug
`pagecraft-db-v3` **before** restarting the Node application. The old application
ignores new gateway operations, while the new application cannot use an old gateway that does not
know them. Keep
`verify_jwt=false`: this function deliberately uses its own gateway-key authentication.

For a fresh project, generate a random gateway key, apply the migrations, and insert its digest:

```sql
insert into public.gateway_config (id, secret_hash)
values ('primary', '<sha256-of-new-gateway-key>');
```

Put the raw key in cPanel as `DATABASE_GATEWAY_KEY`. Never put it in SQL, a migration, a shell
history file, or this repository.

## Enable scheduled publishing

Scheduling stays dark until a trigger is configured: without one, owners never see
**Schedule…**. Turn it on per environment, staging first, in this order:

1. Run the three `deno` checks above, then deploy `supabase/functions/pagecraft-db/` as
   `pagecraft-db-v3`. This adds `site.publishScheduled`; older applications ignore it. There is
   no SQL migration: schedules are files under `PAGECRAFT_PUBLICATION_ROOT/.schedules/`.
2. In the application's environment, set `PAGECRAFT_SCHEDULE_RUNNER_KEY` to a random value of
   at least 32 characters, and optionally `PAGECRAFT_SCHEDULE_RUNNER=1` for the 60-second
   in-process timer. This timer is separate from `PAGECRAFT_BACKGROUND_WORKERS`, which stays `0`
   on staging. Restart, and the log should say `scheduling enabled`.
3. Passenger may idle the process, so cron wakes it. Keep the key out of the crontab line:
   put `Authorization: Bearer <key>` in a file readable only by the account (`chmod 600`),
   then add:

```sh
* * * * * curl -fsS -m 50 -X POST -H @$HOME/.pagecraft-schedules-staging.header https://staging.itspagecraft.com/api/internal/publication-schedules/run >/dev/null
```

4. Accept on the labeled QA site. Prepare a review preview and schedule it a few minutes out.
   Confirm it publishes, the owner gets a notice, and a manual publish in the meantime pauses
   the schedule instead of being overwritten.

## Backups and recovery

The current Supabase Free plan does not provide the automatic daily backup guarantee used by a
customer-facing production service. Run the encrypted backup job on an off-server runner and keep
its output in separate off-site storage. The exact commands, retention policy, integrity checks,
and disposable-project restore drill are in [`RECOVERY.md`](../RECOVERY.md).

Do not call a backup complete until its encrypted artifact and checksum have left both Namecheap
and the Supabase project. Run and record a restore drill before launch and at least quarterly.

## TLS renewal

The origin certificate is a Let's Encrypt certificate installed through cPanel. Renewal is
handled by the existing user crontab through:

```text
/home/itspbuku/pagecraft-ops/acme-home/acme.sh
```

Renewal uses the HTTP webroot at `/home/itspbuku/build.itspagecraft.com`, so no Cloudflare API
credential is stored on the server. The deploy hook installs renewed certificates through
cPanel UAPI. The same renewal runner also maintains the separate apex/`www` landing certificate.

## Verify

```bash
node tools/smoke.mjs https://build.itspagecraft.com

curl -I https://build.itspagecraft.com/
curl -I http://build.itspagecraft.com/
```

Expected: the HTTPS root redirects to `/sign-in` with HSTS; HTTP redirects to HTTPS; the observable
smoke suite passes; and `/sign-in` renders the password form with Turnstile. Complete one verified
account smoke flow separately and confirm the auth cookie is `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`,
and scoped to `/`. Restart Passenger once and confirm the profile and sites remain in Supabase.

## Current production note

Do not mark account launch live until the schema/gateway, Supabase Auth/SMTP/redirect configuration,
application, and authenticated smoke verification have been completed in that order.
