/* ---- 0b. the core comes from TypeScript now -----------------------------
   app/src/core/ is the source of truth. The legacy single-file build compiles it
   back in, so the port never leaves two copies of four thousand lines drifting
   apart — which is the failure mode a strangler migration is most prone to.

   The nine `/*<core>*\/` regions are replaced by one bundle hoisted to where the
   first of them was. That is sound because the core is self-contained: it calls
   nothing the UI defines, so nothing it needs can come later. The `var` bindings
   below let the remaining UI code keep referring to core symbols by bare name,
   which is what makes this a move rather than a rewrite. */

   Three approaches, and the reasons the first two lost:
     - an IIFE with `var x = __PC.x` bindings died on `svg is not defined`, because
       the binding list was hand-written and covered the *test* surface rather than
       everything the UI touches.
     - a plain type-strip worked while the core was one file, but cannot follow an
       `import` — and the whole point now is to split it into modules.
   An ESM bundle concatenates every module into one scope with its declarations still
   at top level, which is exactly the shape a classic script needs. Cut the one
   trailing `export { … }` and the remaining UI code keeps referring to core symbols
   by bare name, whatever the file layout underneath. */

     first idea, and a hand-written list is exactly what went stale before: a second
     copy to drift from the first. This is the first list, reshaped. `export { a, b };` becomes
     `var __CORE = { a, b };` and nothing can fall out of step.

   Not spliced into the shared scope like the core is, and the reason is concrete
   rather than stylistic: Preact's bundle declares `$` at top level, and builder.html
   has declared `$` as its DOM query helper since the first commit. One scope for both
   is `Identifier '$' has already been declared` — a SyntaxError that takes the whole
   app with it. So this stays sealed, exports one `mount`, and receives everything it
   needs as arguments.

   The guard below is the same idea as the control-parity check: assert the property
   the design depends on rather than trusting it to stay true. If a future esbuild
